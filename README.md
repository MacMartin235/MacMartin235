## New Here, Be Gentle
I'm a hobby programmer who learned in high school and I make fun projects for my own entertainment.

I'm learning git for the first time because previously my method was saving multiple files named by the date I made them on my computer and keeping a .txt file with file changes which I constantly forgot to update.

## My Projects
I'm currently working on a single-page website that has a character sheet and a card search function for the TTRPG, Daggerheart Open Beta v1.5.
